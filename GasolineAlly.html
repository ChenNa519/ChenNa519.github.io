    <p>
        A fast-paced top-down survival game where players refuel escaping cars using a custom pressure-sensor controller.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This top-down survival game challenges players to keep escaping cars running by refueling them in time, using a custom-built pressure-sensor controller. As the pace accelerates, players must react quickly and manage multiple vehicles to prevent them from running out of gas and getting caught. The physical input adds urgency and tension, turning a simple refueling task into a fast-paced and engaging survival experience.
    </p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>

    <h3>Programmer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented the refueling mechanic and input system using a custom pressure-sensor controller</li>
      <li>Contributed to the design of core gameplay mechanics through collaborative discussion and prototyping</li>
      <li>Participated in level and tutorial design by shaping how players learn and interact with the refueling system</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- <h3>N/A</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul> -->

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        As an early project, this experience primarily helped us become familiar with pacing of BVW. With more time, the mechanics and level flow could be refined in greater details.
