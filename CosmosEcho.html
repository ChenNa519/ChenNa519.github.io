    <h1>Cosmos Echo</h1>

    <p>
        A VR narrative experience exploring love, death, and the cosmos.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This VR narrative places the player in the role of an astronaut whose oxygen supply is slowly running out. Drifting through space, the player uses a telescope to observe distant stars and fragments of the universe, searching for traces of love amid isolation and impending loss. The experience blends quiet interaction with reflective storytelling, inviting players to contemplate connection, impermanence, and the vastness of the cosmos.

      <li>Implemented the telescope interaction mechanic as the core way players explore the environment</li>
      <li>Developed the monitor / hologram logic used for narrative presentation</li>
      <li>Built level logic to support progression within the experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        This project was designed for a naïve guest audience and developed within the two-week timeframe of BVW. Through playtesting, we observed that players’ interpretations of the experience varied significantly—features that felt clear to some players could introduce confusion for others. This highlighted the challenge of balancing clarity and openness, especially when working with limited time and a constrained set of features.
